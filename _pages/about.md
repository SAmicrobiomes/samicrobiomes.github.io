Oliver is a Research Scientist at the University of Pretoria where he leads a Microbiome@UP research group. His research involves using evolutionary genomics to study gene exchange events and microevolutionary processes that shape microbial communities in their natural habitats. This includes developing methodologies to discover novel prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses and how these may influence microbiome structures and biogeochemical cycles using sequence data. His ongoing research involves work in different systems ranging from the ocean, freshwater, the human gut, and terrestrial ecosystems. He employs meta-omics (metagenomics, single-cell genomics, and phylogenomics) to fully explore the evolution and ecological roles of the microbiome from a community to a single-cell level.
